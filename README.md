# coding-challenges

This repository is split into two parts:
* One section, called *leetcode*, will be used to document *Daily Challenge* problems, found on the "Problems" tab of that same website
* The other section, called *personal* will include projects I will have created on my own initiative or for my own utlity, code I wrote following along with video tutorials on the Web to learn a particular concept, and other challenges I received **from outside of Leetcode.**
